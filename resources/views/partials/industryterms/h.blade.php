    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Hard Money Loan</strong><br>A loan typically secured by a hard asset such as residential or commercial real estate. Such loans usually have high interest rates relative to bank loans due to the short duration (i.e. 12-month term). Hard money lenders typically look more to asset value rather than at the credit characteristics of the potential borrower as the primary loan underwriting factor. Hard money lending is very useful to those who are in need of quick financing since these loans can be closed in as little as a few days. Hard money loans have higher interest rates due to their higher risk and quick service.</li>
